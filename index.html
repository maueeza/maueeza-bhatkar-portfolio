    <h1>Maueeza's component library</h1>
    <p>I am attending neog.camp and I am currently completing levelZero one weekend and assignment at a time</p>
    <p>This is a component library created by me to better design each element</p>
    <p>I am using this to understand paragraphs, headings, typography</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>@typography</h2>
    <h1>This is biggest heading h1</h1>
    <h2>This is second biggest heading h2</h2>
    <p>This is normal text. Long running text would look like this on your website. This will auto fold based on width</p>
    <small>This is relatively smaller text</small>
